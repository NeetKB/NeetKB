## Hi there 👋, I'm Avnita

With a background in the legal industry, I bring a unique perspective to software programming, combining analytical detail, communication skills, and problem-solving skills developed in a professional environment. Transitioning into technology, I have built a strong foundation in full-stack development through intensive bootcamps and hands-on projects, specializing in modern tools and languages. My legal career equipped me with the skills to break down complex problems, structure data-driven arguments, and navigate collaborative workflows—skills that seamlessly transfer to designing and implementing efficient, user-focused software solutions.

I am commited to implemmeting software solutions that implement web accessibility features first (not as an add on) by implementing the WC3 standards and principles. Any resources or help to implement this is greatly appreciated.


What I am currently working on:
-	Health Tracker Project
-	Keeping my skills sharp
- reading …
- and studying ….

### Web development projects
I studied full-stack engineering at the Makers Academy bootcamp. The course focused on pair programming, test driven development, agile processes, and learning by creating projects. Below are my projects that demonstrate my technology and language skills:
