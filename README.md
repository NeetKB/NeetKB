## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Avnita

With a background in the legal industry, I bring a unique perspective to software programming, combining analytical detail, communication skills, and problem-solving skills developed in a professional environment. Transitioning into technology, I have built a strong foundation in full-stack development through intensive bootcamps and hands-on projects, specializing in modern tools and languages. My legal career equipped me to break down complex problems, structure data-driven arguments, and navigate collaborative workflowsâ€”skills that seamlessly transfer to designing and implementing efficient, user-focused software solutions.
